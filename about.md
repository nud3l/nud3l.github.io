        Imagine you have an autonomous car. Wouldn't it be great if your car could earn money for you while you are not using it? The car could register itself in an app as a driver, charge itself and pay for it, and get itself fixed at a garage, if needed. To enable these capabilities the car needs to be able to communicate with these other entities, agree on the terms of interaction, and have some measures to handle disputes or finding prices for services or goods. This involves a great deal of open questions.

As of October 2017 I am Research Assistant at the [Imperial Centre for Cryptocurrency Research and Engineering (IC3RE)]("http://www.imperial.ac.uk/cryptocurrency/"){:target="_blank"} where I try to answer a couple of these questions. I am especially curious about verifiable computations, secure multi-party computations, reputation management systems, and smart contract research.


Apart from my own research, I coordinate research projects together with IC3RE and
[Outlier Ventures](https://outlierventures.io){:target="blank"}. We are working together
with start-ups including [Fetch](http://fetch.ai){:target="_blank"},
[Sovrin](https://sovrin.org/){:target="_blank"}, [SEED](https://www.seedtoken.io/){:target="_blank"}, [Haja](https://haja.io/){:target="_blank"}, and 
[Ocean](https://oceanprotocol.com/){:target="_blank"} to advance distributed ledger research and technology.	The purpose is to combine distributed ledgers with other technologies such as machine learning, autonomous agents, IoT, and bots to expedite the next web.https://haja.io/
