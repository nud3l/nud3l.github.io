						<h2>Who am I</h2>
						<p>
							As of November 2016 I am researching smart contracts and trust in
							blockchain systems at <a href="https://www.sics.se/groups/decisions-networks-and-analytics-lab-dna">
							SICS DNA lab</a>. This project idea started out when I was playing around
							with Ethereum. To get familiar with it, I searched for a project and
							started to build an autonomous hedge fund. However, I wanted to integrate social
							criteria as well. I soon learned that this is a non-trivial problem without straight forward solutions.
							The current project <a href="https://github.com/nud3l/dInvest"> dInvest </a>
							uses external agents for the selection of financial assets. But, how can one trust external agents
							and apply the transparency and anonymity principles as promoted by blockchain solutions?
							To dig into these questions, I started my thesis project.
						</p>
						<p>
							Apart from that I am curious about distributed systems like Cassandra and web technologies including Jekyll and Tornado.
							Before I started my master studies, I worked three years as a consultant for cloud computing and cyber-security at
							PwC. There I got an excellent deep dive of efforts to securely build and integrate distributed systems in an enterprise setting
							and to apply cloud computing principles.

								<h3><a href="blockchain/2017/01/10/dinvest.html">dInvest: a social hedge fund in Ethereum</a></h3>
								<p>Selecting a suitable financial investment, ethical and social criteria are becoming critical success factors. The core issue is finding a suitable framework for sustainable and profitable investment in combination with full transparency over the decision process and transactions. We are working on a proof-of-concept to realize profitable, transparent and socially responsible investment. </p>

								<h3><a href="ai/2017/01/12/breakingcaptcha.html">Breaking CAPTCHAs using deep learning</a></h3>
								<p>The aim of the project is to break CAPTCHAs using deep learning technologies. Initially the focus lies on simple CAPTCHAs to evaluate the performance and move into more complex CAPTCHAs. The training dataset is generated from an open source CAPTCHA generation software. Tensorflow is used to create, train and test the network.</p>
