						<h2>Who am I</h2>
						<p>
							Imagine you have an autonomous car. Wouldn't it be great if your car could earn money
							for you while you are not using it? The car could register itself in an app as a driver,
							charge itself and pay for it, and get itself fixed at a garage, if needed. To enable these
							capabilities the car needs to be able to communicate with these other entities,
							agree on the terms of interaction, and have some measures to handle disputes or finding prices
							for services or goods. This involves a great deal of open questions.
						</br>
							As of October 2017 I am Research Assistant at the 
							<a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/cryptocurrency/">
								Imperial Centre for Cryptocurrency Research and Engineering (IC3RE)
							</a> where I try to answer a couple of these questions.
							I am especially curious about verifiable computations,
							secure multi-party computations, reputation management systems, and 
							smart contract research.
						</br>
							Apart from my own research, I coordinate research projects together with IC3RE and
							<a href="https://outlierventures.io">Outlier Ventures</a>. We are working together
							with start-ups including <a href="http://fetch.ai">Fetch.AI</a>,
							<a href="https://iota.org">IOTA</a>,
							<a href="https://botanic.io">Botanic</a>, and 
							<a href="https://www.evernym.com">Evernym</a> to advance distributed ledger research
							and technology.	The purpose is to combine distributed ledgers with other technologies 
							such as autonomous agents, IoT, and bots to expedite the next web.

								<h3><a href="blockchain/2017/01/10/dinvest.html">dInvest: a social hedge fund in Ethereum</a></h3>
								<p>Selecting a suitable financial investment, ethical and social criteria are becoming critical success factors. The core issue is finding a suitable framework for sustainable and profitable investment in combination with full transparency over the decision process and transactions. We are working on a proof-of-concept to realize profitable, transparent and socially responsible investment. </p>

								<h3><a href="ai/2017/01/12/breakingcaptcha.html">Breaking CAPTCHAs using deep learning</a></h3>
								<p>The aim of the project is to break CAPTCHAs using deep learning technologies. Initially the focus lies on simple CAPTCHAs to evaluate the performance and move into more complex CAPTCHAs. The training dataset is generated from an open source CAPTCHA generation software. Tensorflow is used to create, train and test the network.</p>
