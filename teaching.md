I had the pleasure to supervise a range of students for their master thesis, [UROP](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/urop/), and group projects. A selection of projects can be found here. If you are interested on working on a project with me, please reach out.

<h1 class="docs-header">Individual projects</h1>

## [Privacy-preserving machine learning](https://medium.com/@apfelbeck.florian/secure-multiparty-computation-enabling-privacy-preserving-machine-learning-ffef396b8ca2)

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-apfelbeck-00139674" target="_blank">Florian Apfelbeck's</a> master thesis project was to develop a privacy-preserving machine learning project. In this project, a Multi-Party Computation (MPC) protocol was used to realise a linear regression and a shallow neural network implementation without reveling input data of the participants in the protocol. 

## [DAGsim: Simulation of DAG-based distributed ledger protocols](https://github.com/IC3RE/DAGsim)

I worked with [Manuel Zander](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wmzander/) and [Tom Waite](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-waite/) to create a simulator for decentralised ledgers that use a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) instead of the usual blockchain. We investigated their properties and our results are summarised in a [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1062) published at SOCCA 2018.

## [Privacy-analysis in a zero-knowledge ledger](https://github.com/masterfunk75/Hyperledger-De-anonymizing)

[Amine Kakouche](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amine-kakouche-49114412b) created a neural network method to anlyse the ledger by the [Hyperledger Indy project](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node#about-indy-node). The project showed that the ledger itself cannot be analysed using statistical methods, however, in an emulated environment learning on metadata of network packages is possible.

<h1 class="docs-header">Group projects</h1>

## [TCR experimentation tool](https://github.com/TCR-Simulator)

Six students at Imperial created a [Token Curated Registry](https://medium.com/@ilovebagels/token-curated-registries-1-0-61a232f8dac7) (TCR) simulator that allows designers to experiments with different parameters in TCRs. Their experiences are documented in a [series of blog posts](https://outlierventures.io/research/the-journey-of-6-students-discovering-tcr-part-1/) and give a good insight how software engineering projects at Imperial are executed.


## [Decentralised Exchange on OrbitDB](https://github.com/IC3RE/orbitdb-dex)

Decentralised exchanges (DEX) promise to be safe against centralised providers having custody over funds and are an active area of research. A group of students build a version of a DEX using [OrbitDB](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db), a database build on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) using [CRDTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type) to achieve strong eventual consistency. Exciting technologies!

## [Principles of Distributed Ledgers](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/current-students/courses/467/) tought by [Arthur Gervais](https://arthurgervais.com/)

Decentralized ledgers, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, have gained rapid popularity, attracting the attention of academics, entrepreneurs, economists, and policy-makers. They promise and already create new disruptive markets, and revolutionize how we think of money and financial infrastructure. This course teaches the basics of distributed ledgers.
