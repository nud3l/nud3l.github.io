Blockchains have become a somewhat big hype and when I got into the field the number of resources was still sparse. I am trying to compile here a list of getting started guides and resources that I find generally useful. These are not limited to blockchain related aspects, but will also cover general CS related resources I find useful for blockchain development. Also, the resources are somewhat research related.

I am trying my best to keep this list up-to-date.

### Getting started guides
- This one is fairly old (Oct 2015), but in my humble opinion still one of the best starting resources to wrap your head around the concepts of blockchain and Ethereum specifically. However, the code is examples are old and for looking into actual code, I would recommend other resources. [101 Noon Intro to Smart Contracts by ConsenSys](https://medium.com/@ConsenSys/a-101-noob-intro-to-programming-smart-contracts-on-ethereum-695d15c1dab4).
- This one goes into a bit more detail on the programming part is is somewat up-to-date. [Getting started as Etheruem dev](https://hackernoon.com/getting-started-as-an-ethereum-web-developer-9a2a4ab47baf)
- This is directly from the Etheruem project website and is updated with recent code examples, so a good way to get started once you got the basic concepts. [Decentralised Autonomous Organisation](https://ethereum.org/dao)
