    <p>
        The aim of the project is to break CAPTCHAs using deep learning technologies. Initially the focus lies on simple CAPTCHAs to evaluate the performance and move into more complex CAPTCHAs. The training dataset is generated from an open source CAPTCHA generation software. Tensorflow is used to create, train and test the network.
