- Chains specializing on use case
- Any chain that supports DeFi will likely need the following use case: 
	- pooling liquidity for protocol deployed on top
	- Precompiles for common AMM functions
	- Precompiles for common operations like interest caluclation

Advantages:
- Liquidity can be shared among protocols
- L1 PCV brings use case for L1 governance token apart from governance and transaction fees
