Recently, we discovered that you can test too much and too little at the same time.
In our case, we needed to make sure that we do not release buggy software (surprising requirement there) but some parts of the software were either hard to automate testing for or we jsut did not spend the time to implement tests since we barely managed to get the feature out in time.
I'll share what we did to resolve those two different issues.
