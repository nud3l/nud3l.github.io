Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is nowadays mostly associated with blockchains. However, it also includes other approaches like Directed Acyclic Graphs (e.g. IOTA's Tangle [1], PHANTOM [2], and SPECTRE). Multi-agent system (MAS) research on the other hand deals with various topics related to agents interacting one way or another. MAS includes ontologies, communication protocols, and various interactions as decision making, coalitions, auctions, bargaining, or arguing. In this post I will cover my thoughts on how DLT can support MAS systems and research. Both, MAS and DLT have concepts to support each other.

### The agent itself
First let's take a look at the smallest entity in the system: the agent. This book by Michael Wooldridge [4] gives a great introduction to agents and multi-agent systems. Arguably, an agent can have different properties. The agent could for example be reactive only or be able to make autonomous decisions based on the perception of the environment.
