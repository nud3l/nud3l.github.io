I've been working remotely for more than two years now.
When we started Interlay, we had a lengthy discussion around how we would setup the company: should we build this around and office or remote from the start?
Ultimately we settled on a remote culture.
I found communication to be the hardest aspect of managing a team and growing a company.
Here, I'm sharing communication best practices that help me within a remote setting.

## Communication Best Practices

### 1. Empathy Above All

For me personally, I find that communicating efficiently and empathetically in writing and asynchronously can be difficult.


### 2. Positive Communication is Important





### 3. Communicate Asynchronously to Remove Blockers when People Are Offline

Most of my team works in Europe whereas I'm based in Japan.
I found that by writing each other longer messages that can be read when people start their day, are quite helpful to bring attention on a specific topic.
That is particular helpful when work items can get done when most of the team is not online yet.
The overall idea is to move any blockers from people before they start their workday.
For example, if I'd like to test the system before coming online, the setup can be done when I'm already asleep.
Likewise, I can do a full system test while most of my engineers are sleeping and identify bugs before they come online so we can tackle these during their day.

### 4. Communicate Priorities Clearly

I found that often the lack of direct feedback loops like visual cues, leads to some confusion when writing messages.
Specifically, when writing about a bug detected in the system or a feature request in one of our chat channels, it's pretty unclear what priority this has unless it's explicitly mentioned.
Think about it: if someone said the system has a bug, likely your first thought would be to fix it right away.
However, I think it's the responsibility of the sender of the message to clarify that:
The message should convey what actions (if any) are to be taken right away and what priority the message has.
To avoid confusion we use a `known-issues` channel in which anyone can post critical bugs.
Otherwise, any feedback or discussion can happen in channels but they need to be added to our ticket system and properly prioritized before we do anything about them.

### 5. Discuss Asynchronously and, If Required, Resolve Synchronously

When building a product and growing a company, discussions happen often and frequently.
After all, we are very often doing things we have never done before as a team like building an entirely new feature in the system, coming up with a better financial reporting, scaling a hiring process, or trying to figure out how to efficiently get feedback 20 people in the team.
Discussions are great when they can happen asynchronously where all participants in reaching a decision can give their input and respond to each others thoughts.
We use different tools for this, but all of them usually have a commenting function like Google Docs, Notion, or GitHub issues and PRs.
In the ideal case, we reach a conclusion directly form the asynchronous discussion.
However, when it's not entirely clear what the best way forward is, I found it best to limit the time for asynchronous discussion and reach a common decision in a call.
As a prerequisite for the call, all decision alternatives should be written down and everyone on that call should be familiar with the alternatives.
In practice, most of the time we end up prioritizing different solutions.
For example, we might want to implement a certain feature in an advanced way but due to capacaity and timing restrictions, we tend to opt for the "easy" way out first and, if demand warrants it, tackle the more sophisticated approach later.

### 6. Stick to The Topic and Time

When we have in person meetings, we strive to stick with the topic at hand and keep the time.
Discussions that happen on unrelated or out-of-scope topics disengages participants and wastes time.
This also implies that each meeting should have a clear topic and goal!
Lastly, if we cannot manage to reach the goal of the meeting in the allocated time, it's better to schedule a separte meeting.
In our case, this happens often when we disucss an issue at the end of our stand-ups.
In most cases, it's best to discuss the topic then asynchronously and, if needed, reach a decision in a call.

## What Others Are Thinking

I found the resources below helpful:

- [GitLab Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/): When we started Interlay, we took a lot of inspiration from GitLab. I still find their handbook one of the best resources for remote culture. It also helps that GitLab is a software company as is Interlay so many of the best practices can be adopted.
- [Hubstuff Blog](https://blog.hubstaff.com/remote-communication/): I found that having common ground rules to be a thing that we did not set yet and possibly having them would help. I didn't find the actual tools that we use as important but rather the way we use them. However, a couple of things really help like threads in Discord and avoiding email for communication. One of the last points I find a bit tricky: non-work-related communication via video calls like socials are OK, but I feel that since the social aspect happens from the same desk and screen that work is done, it's just not the same as a in-person social. I think it might be nice to get everyone away from their usual screen for socials, but that might be subject to another post.
- [Know Your Team Blog](https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2020/11/17/5-communication-best-practices-for-remote-teams/): I found those five rules to be quite concise and applicable. I think I personally would add some details like knowing when it's more efficient to switch from asyncrhonous to syncrhonous communication to reach a decision and encouraging people to switch of the communication channels for certain times of the day to get quiet working time.
