    Imagine you have an autonomous car. Wouldn't it be great if your car could earn money for you while you are not using it? The car could register itself in an app as a driver, charge itself and pay for it, and get itself fixed at a garage, if needed. To enable these capabilities the car needs to be able to communicate with a range of other entities, agree on contract terms, and have some measures to handle disputes or finding prices for services or goods. This involves a great deal of open research questions.

Imagine you would carry an agent around that can help you make financial decisions.
Moreover, think that this agent could autonomously select [decentralized financial (DeFi) protocols](https://defipulse.com/){:target="_blank"} in which to invest. And then take it a step further and imagine that your agent can automatically and privately collaborate with other agents to optimally balance your risk and profit criteria.

To enable these capabilities your agents needs to be able to communicate with a range of other agents, ensure that those agents can be trusted, encode the agreed terms into smart contracts, and have some measures to handle disputes. This involves a great deal of open research questions.

## My Work

As of October 2017 I am **researcher** at the [Imperial Centre for Cryptocurrency Research and Engineering (IC3RE)](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/cryptocurrency/){:target="_blank"} where I try to answer a couple of these questions. This includes [encoding trust through financial collateral in open and decentralized systems](https://balance-resear.ch/){:target="_blank"}, [risks and composition of DeFi protocols](https://medium.com/@dominik.harz/stealing-all-of-makers-collateral-f940970605b1){:target="_blank"}, and [interoperability of assets](https://www.xclaim.io/){:target="_blank"}.

As of October 2019, I am the **co-founder and CTO** of [Interlay](https://www.interlay.io/){:target="_blank"} where we build interoperable assets for DeFi. As part of Interlay, we are working on financially secure cross-chain assets and DeFi composability.

<!-- I am especially curious about smart contracts and their verification as well as automated negotiation for autonomous agents. Additionally, I am interested in general distributed and decentralised web research including problems revolving around interoperability of distributed ledgers and privacy-preserving applications. -->

Apart from my own research, I lead the [Outlier Ventures](https://outlierventures.io){:target="_blank"} research programme at [Imperial College](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/178860/ic3re-announces-partnership-explore-convergence-blockchain/){:target="_blank"} and
. We are working together
with companies including [Fetch](http://fetch.ai){:target="_blank"},
[Sovrin](https://sovrin.org/){:target="_blank"}, [SEED](https://www.seedtoken.io/){:target="_blank"}, [Haja](https://haja.io/){:target="_blank"}, and 
[Ocean](https://oceanprotocol.com/){:target="_blank"} to advance distributed ledger research and technology.
 <!-- The purpose is to combine distributed ledgers with other technologies such as machine learning, autonomous agents, IoT, and bots to expedite the next web. -->
