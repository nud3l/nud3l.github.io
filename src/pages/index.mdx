## About Me

Hi, I'm Dominik Harz (most people call me Dom), a computer scientist and entrepreneur. I'm passionate about building decentralized systems that enable people to collaborate and build better societies.

## My Work

I'm currently building two major projects as CTO at Distributed Crafts:

- [Interlay](https://interlay.io): Interlay is a decentralized network for bridging Bitcoin to other blockchains. It is the first bridge that allows anyone to join as an intermediary (fully permissionless). The bridge is also fully secured by collateral making it both decentralized and minimizing trust in its operators. Interlay is based on the [XCLAIM](https://xclaim.io) protocol that I co-authored during my PhD.
- [BOB](https://gobob.xyz): BOB is a rollup and sidechain stack that allows building smart contracts (with the EVM and other VMs) while inheriting Bitcoin security. BOB's first deployment is based on the [OP Stack](https://docs.optimism.io/) and is currently in development.

I did my PhD at the [Imperial College London cryptocurrency lab](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/cryptocurrency) with [William Knottenbelt](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~wjk/) where I met some of the greatest people I had the chance to work with on DeFi and its security, cross-chain protocols, and smart contracts. To get an idea of my work, please have a look at my [publications](/publications).

## Outside Work

When I'm not in front of a computer, you will find me outdoors chasing waves, doing triathlons, hiking, or skiing.
